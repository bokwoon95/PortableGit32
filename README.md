How To Use:
-----------
Copy this folder and use it from anywhere (be it on the computer or a USB stick). Open `git.bat` to use, not `git-bash.exe` (git-bash has almost zero setup due to its wonky `$HOME` directory configuration)

Features:
---------
- vim (with personal config)
- git (and tig)
- SSH (and scp), no PuTTY required.
- [csv2xlsx_386](https://gitlab.com/DerLinkshaender/csv2xlsx), converts csv to xlsx files without needing Excel.
- [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/), (bulk) download videos & music from youtube without needing conversion websites.
- ssh-setup.sh, setup ssh keys automatically by logging in once into the server.
